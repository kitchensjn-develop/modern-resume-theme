    The goal of the TopoTable Project is to create a dynamic 3D topographic relief table that is built with moveable pillars. Rather than constraining it to a single region, the motors within the TopoTable would allow it to seamlessly shift from one map to the next. I have developed the user interface for downloading and processing elevation data using <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>R</mark>, <mark>Leaflet</mark> and <mark>Shiny</mark>. This application is hosted through <mark>shinyapps.io</mark>.

    In October 2019, Dr. Paul Bartels and I collaborated to develop a <mark>Shiny</mark> application that would display aggregated marine tardigrade findings from [Kaczmarek, L., Bartels, P.J., Roszkowska, M. & Nelson, D. (2015). The Zoogeography of Marine Tardigrada, *Zootaxa* 4037:1-189](https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4037.1.1){:target="_blank"}. Using <mark>R</mark>, this application accesses data through the Google Sheets API, allowing for quick and efficient updating of findings without the need for a full redeploy. Findings are then displayed within a <mark>Leaflet</mark> map, hosted through <mark>shinyapps.io</mark>.

    In collaboration with the Visualization Studies Research Studio at the University of Washington, I am developing a lichen-inspired visualization of personal data related to mental health tracking.
